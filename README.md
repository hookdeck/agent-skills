## You Say -> Skill Used

| What you say | Skill |
|---|---|
| "Set up Hookdeck for my project" | `event-gateway` |
| "Receive webhooks from Stripe" | `event-gateway` |
| "Test webhooks locally" | `event-gateway` |

## Event Gateway Workflow

The `event-gateway` skill includes a staged integration workflow:

1. **Setup** -- Create account, install CLI, create connection
2. **Scaffold** -- Build webhook handler with verification code (for provider webhooks like Stripe or Shopify, use event-gateway together with the matching skill from [webhook-skills](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills))
3. **Listen** -- Start `hookdeck listen`, trigger test events
4. **Iterate** -- Debug failures, fix code, replay events
