# Test Fixtures

Placeholder for future **debug-webhooks** scenario fixtures.

When we add the debug scenario, this directory will contain intentionally broken handler projects (e.g. wrong signature encoding, missing raw body) per framework (express, nextjs, fastapi). The agent is given the broken project and must diagnose and fix it.

No fixtures yet; deferred until basic scenarios are proven.
